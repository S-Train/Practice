# We took the code for the Calypso rhythm (see below), which was
# written in sample/sleep format, and compressed it into a couple
# of rings. To simplify the rings, we also defined two variables:

kick = :drum_heavy_kick
tom  = :drum_tom_hi_soft

use_bpm 200

def beat
  
  tick
  
  drums = (ring kick, tom, kick, tom, kick, tom, tom, kick, tom)
  drums_sleep = (ring 1.5, 0.5, 1, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 1)
  
  sample drums.look
  sleep drums_sleep.look
end


beat
